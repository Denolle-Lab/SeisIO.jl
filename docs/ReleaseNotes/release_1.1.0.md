The minor version has been incremented for strict compliance with semantic versioning, because the SAC change could break user work flows that match `:id` against SAC data files. Otherwise this is a patch for 1.0.0, focused primarily on documentation updates. All bug fixes and consistency changes address rare or minor issues.

# 1. **Public API Changes**
## **SAC**
* SAC data files no longer track the LOC field of `:id`; thus, IDs `NN.SSSSS.LL.CCC` and `NN.SSSSS..CCC` will be written and read identically to/from SAC.
  + This change realigns SeisIO SAC handling with the [official format spec](http://ds.iris.edu/files/sac-manual/manual/file_format.html).
  + *Explanation*: Some data sources store the LOC field of `:id` in KHOLE (byte offset 464). We followed this convention through SeisIO v1.0.0. However, KHOLE is an event property, not a station property.

# 2. **Bug Fixes**
* SEED submodule support functions (e.g. `mseed_support()`) now correctly info dump to stdout
* *merge!* is now logged in a way that *show_processing* catches
* *read_qml* on an event with no magnitude element now yields an empty `:hdr.mag`
* *show* now reports true number of gaps when `:x` has a gap before the last sample
* Fixed two breaking bugs that were probably never seen in real data:
  * Extending a time matrix by appending a one-sample segment to `:x` can no longer break time handling; see changes to *t_extend* for fix details.
  + *write_hdf5* with *ovr=false* no longer overwrites a trace in an output volume when two sample windows have the same ID, start time string, and end time string; instead, the tag string is incremented. This previously happened when two or more segments from one channel started and ended within the same calendar second.
* The data processing functions *ungap!*, *taper!*, *env!*, *filtfilt!*, and *resample!* now correctly skip irregularly-sampled channels.
* Irregularly-sampled channels are no longer writable to ASDF, which, by design, cannot handle irregularly-sampled data.
* ASDF groups and datasets are now always closed after reading with *read_hdf5*.

# 3. **Consistency Changes**
* *get_data* with *w=true* now logs the raw download write to *:notes*
* *seedlink, seedlink!* now accept keyword *seq="* for starting sequence number, consistent with [SeisComp3 protocols](https://www.seiscomp3.org/doc/seattle/2012.279/apps/seedlink.html)
* *show* now identifies times in irregular data as "vals", not "gaps"
* *show_writes* now prints the filename in addition to the write operation
* *write_qml* now:
  - writes `:hdr.loc.typ` to *Event/Origin/type*
  - writes `:hdr.loc.npol` to *Event/focalMechanism/stationPolarityCount*
  - has a method for direct write of *SeisEvent* structures
* *write_sxml* now works with all GphysData subtypes
* *read_data* now uses verbosity for formats "slist" and "lennartz"

## **SeisIO Test Scripts**
Fixed some rare bugs that could break automated tests.
* *test/TestHelpers/check_get_data.jl*: now uses a *try-catch* loop for *FDSNWS station* requests
* *tests/Processing/test_merge.jl*: testing *xtmerge!* no longer allows total timespan *Î´t >  typemax(Int64)*
* *tests/Quake/test_fdsn.jl*: KW *src="all"* is no longer tested; too long, too much of a timeout risk
* *tests/Web/test_fdsn.jl*: bad request channels are deleted before checking file write accuracy
* Tests now handle time and data comparison of re-read data more robustly

# 4. **Other Changes**
* Most internal functions have now switched from keywords to positional args.
  * RandSeis: `populate_arr!`, `populate_chan!`
  * SeisHDF: `write_asdf` (note: doesn't affect `write_hdf5`)
  * SeisIO: `FDSN_sta_xml` , `FDSNget!` , `IRISget!` , `fdsn_chp` , `irisws` , `parse_charr` , `parse_chstr` , `read_station_xml!` , `read_sxml` , `sxml_mergehdr!` , `trid`
* Rewrote SeisIO.RandSeis for faster structure generation
  + randSeisChannel has two new keywords: *fs_min* and *fc*
  + randSeisData has two new keywords: *fs_min* and *a0*
* [Official documentation](https://seisio.readthedocs.io/) updated
* Many docstrings have been updated and standardized. Notable changes:
  + *?timespec* is now *?TimeSpec*
  + *?chanspec* is now *?web_chanspec*
  + *?taper* now exists
  + *?seedlink* keywords table corrected
  + Quake:
    - *?EventChannel* now produces a docstring, rather than an error
    - *?get_pha!* now describes the correct function
* Updated and expanded the tutorial

## *sync!*
Rewritten based on @tclements suggestions (Issue #31). Notable changes:
* Much less memory use
* Much faster; ~6x speedup on tests with 3 channels of length ~10^7 samples
* More robust handling of unusual time matrices (e.g., segments out of order)

## **Internals**
* *t_extend* is now more robust and no longer needs a mini-API
  + previously, some rare cases of time matrix extension could break. They were likely never present in real data -- e.g., a time matrix with a gap before the last sample would break when extended by another sample -- but these "end-member" cases were theoretically possible.
  + the rewrite covers and tests all possible cases of time matrix extension.
* *check_for_gap!* is now a thin wrapper to *t_extend*, ensuring uniform behavior
* The internal functions in SeisIO.RandSeis have changed significantly.
