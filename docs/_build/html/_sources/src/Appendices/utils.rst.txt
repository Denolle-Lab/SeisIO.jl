Event Utilities
===============
The following utilities are for acquisition and storage of discrete event data.

gcdist
------
Compute great-circle distance between source and receiver(s) by the Haversine formula.

getpha
------
Get phase onset times relative to the origin time of an event.

distaz!
-------
Update SeisEvent object S with distances(in degrees), azimuth, and backazimuth for each channel. Values are saved in S.data.misc["dist"], S.data.misc["az"], and S.data.misc["baz"], respectively.

Miscellaneous
=============
``getbandcode(fs, fc=FC)``: Generate a valid FDSN-compliant one-character band code for data sampled at ``fs``; corner frequency ``FC`` is optional.

``tx = t_expand(t)``: Expand sparse delta-encoded time representation ``t`` to generate time stamps for for each value in the corresponding data ``x``.

``t = t_collapse(tx)``: Collapse time stamp array ``tx`` to sparse delta-encoded time representation ``t``.

``j = md2j(y,m,d)``: Convert month ``m``, day ``d`` of year ``y`` to Julian day (day of year) ``j``. Not included in the Julia DateTime library.

``m,d = j2md(y,j)``: Convert Julian day (day of year) ``j`` of year ``y`` to month ``m``, day ``d``. Not included in the Julia DateTime library.
