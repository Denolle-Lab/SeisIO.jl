:mod:`Appendix A: SeisData Fields`
**********************************
All field names use lowercase letters. SeisData and SeisObj types have identical field types; SeisData objects have the additional field ``n``.


Field Names and Meanings
========================
* ``n``: (SeisData only) number of channels

* ``id``: unique channel identifier, formated using the subfields ``nn.sssss.ll.ccc``. Contains no whitespace.

  * ``nn``: two-letter network code

  * ``sssss``: station code, up to five characters

  * ``ll``: location code, typically numeric

  * ``ccc``: channel code; follow the `SEED format appendices  <http://www.fdsn.org/seed_manual/SEEDManual_V2.4_Appendix-A.pdf>`_

* ``name``: unique freeform string for channel name\ :sup:`(a)`

* ``src``: freeform string describing data source\ :sup:`(a)`

*  ``fs``: sampling frequency in Hz

* ``gain``: scalar value by which data are divided to obtain measurements in SI units in the "flat" part of the frequency spectrum

* ``units``: units of the dependent variable (MKS is recommended, with "m/s" for velocity and "m/s/s" for acceleration)\ :sup:`(a)`

* ``loc``: sensor location, a 5-entry vector of the form [lat, lon, ele, |thgr|, |phgr|]

  * lat: latitude in decimal degrees (+ = North)

  * lon: longitude in decimal degrees (+ = East)

  * ele: elevation in meters above sea level

  * |thgr|: channel azimuth in degrees clockwise from North

  * |phgr|: channel incidence in degrees from vertical

* ``resp``: complex instrument response (poles and zeros), with zeros in ``resp[:,1]`` and poles in ``resp[:,2]``

* ``misc``: dictionary of miscellaneous information

* ``notes``: array of notes

* ``t``: pseudo-sparse two-column array of times

* ``x``: vector of sample data


:sup:`(a)` Only the first 26 characters of each channel's ``name``, ``units``, and ``src`` strings are written to file. Longer strings are truncated.


Notes on Specific Fields
========================

``id``
------
Subfields of ``id`` should contain alphanumeric characters.  An ``id`` value shouldn't contain whitespace. Never set a ``name`` field to an ``id`` field of a different channel.

``gain``
--------
The ``gain`` field has an identical meaning to the "Stage 0" gain of FDSN/SeedLink station/channel XML files.

``misc``
--------
Always use static types to declare arrays in ``misc`` (e.g. ``Array{Float64,N}``; never ``Array{Any,N}``). Although values in ``misc`` can be of any type, there are strict limitations on what value types can be saved to disk:

Scalars and single-type arrays of the follwoing types are OK: ``Char, Complex64, Complex128, DirectIndexString, Float32, Float64, Integer, Unsigned``. Other types will be ignored during file write and warning messages will be given when non-writable values are encountered. Subtypes of the listed types are OK; for example, ``ASCIIString`` and ``Array{ASCIIString,N}`` are both supported.

``notes``
---------
The ``notes`` array grows automatically as data are modified. Any ``merge`` or ``sync`` operation is automatically noted. Additional notes can be written manually using the ``note`` command.

``t``
-----
For time series data (``fs > 0``), ``t`` is a sparse delta-encoded representation of *time gaps* in the correspoding data ``x``. The first column stores *indices*; the second column stores gap lengths in *seconds*.

* The second column of the first row, i.e. ``t[1,2]``, always stores the time of the first sample in ``x`` relative to the Unix epoch (0.0 = 1970-01-01T00:00:00).

* The last row of ``t`` should always take the form ``[length(x) 0.0]``.

* Other rows should take the form ``[(start of gap in x) (length of gap)]``.

For irregularly sampled data (``fs = 0``), ``t`` is a sparse delta-encoded representation of time stamps, one per sample. In this case, only the second column of ``t`` is used. The first column is usually a column of zeros.
